Welcome to our Tic Tac Toe game project! This is a classic two-player game developed by our team consisting of James Osho Thomas, Hammed Tiamiyu, and Saleem Jibril. In this game, players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, traditionally 'X' and 'O', to form a line of three of their characters either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features
